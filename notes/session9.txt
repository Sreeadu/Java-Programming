The first part of encapsulation is about putting related things in the same class.
like you can put all your car stuff in one class and your monkey stuff in another class. 
if you put your monkey stuff and your car stuff together, it will mess up your program and look really unorganized.

The second part is about hiding things that are there but dont need to be seen.
when you start up your car, the gas is being pumped and your chamber is being ignited. 
but you dont see it happening everytime you start you car, do you? no. 
the car people put it there because it needs to happen, but they dont show you because you dont need to see it.
if you put private in front, instead of public, the program will hide the method, even if it is called in the main method.

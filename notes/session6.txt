- you can make your own class/datatype!
- outside of static, label the features of the class
- ^remember to write the type first and then the name of the feature, dont forget to include syntax
- ^also write the code below the title of the class though
- to use the class, write: Person p1 = new Person ();
- refer to MyOwnDataSample
- not every line ends with ;
